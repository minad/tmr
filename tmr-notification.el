;; Provides a function to display a desktop notification.  This is
;; useful to get a passive popup when a timer completes.
;;
;; Please read the manual for all the technicalities.  Either evaluate
;; (info "(tmr) Top") or visit <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/tmr>.
;;
;; Developers can also read (info "(elisp) Desktop Notifications") for
;; details.

;;; Code:
(require 'tmr)
(require 'tmr-sound)
(require 'notifications)

(defcustom tmr-notification-urgency 'normal
  "The urgency level of the desktop notification.
Values can be `low', `normal' (default), or `critical'.

The desktop environment or notification daemon is responsible for
such notifications."
  :type '(choice
          (const :tag "Low" low)
          (const :tag "Normal" normal)
